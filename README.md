Nowadays mobile equipment have often more than one
single network interface. For instance, laptops have usually
at least both a wired (Ethernet) and a wireless (Wifi) network adapters. Similarly smartphones and tablet PCs can
reach the Internet either through Wifi or through a cellular
network (UMTS or 3G+).
Another fact is that network operators usually duplicate
links and equipments in order to protect their networks
against failures, especially in the access and the backhaul
networks. Moreover the backbone networks are generally
meshed. In this context many paths may exist between any
two endpoints. The idea to use concurrently many paths has
then emerged, to improve the robustness and performance of
end-to-end connections. Such multipath connections can indeed balance the load between the different paths, switching
dynamically and automatically the traffic from congested,
disrupted or broken links to the best paths.
